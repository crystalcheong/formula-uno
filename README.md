# F1 Podium Prediction Model - 2025 Dutch Grand Prix
## Project Overview
A machine learning pipeline for predicting Formula 1 race outcomes using historical telemetry data, practice session performance, and meteorological conditions. The model successfully predicted the podium positions for the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix using supervised learning techniques.

**Final Predictions**:

ðŸ¥‡ **P1**: Oscar Piastri (McLaren) - 87.29s
ðŸ¥ˆ **P2**: Lando Norris (McLaren) - 87.68s
ðŸ¥‰ **P3**: Max Verstappen (Red Bull) - 89.13s

## Technical Architecture
### Data Pipeline

Source: FastF1 API for telemetry and session data
Temporal Coverage: 2024-2025 F1 seasons
Tracks: Zandvoort (2024), Imola, Suzuka, Miami (2025)
Sample Size: 60 driver-race combinations

## Feature Engineering
### Core Features

Clean Air Race Pace: Best lap time across FP1/FP2/FP3 sessions with track status filtering
Grid Performance: Qualifying position and gap to pole position
Teammate Comparison: Relative qualifying performance within teams
Practice-to-Race Analysis: Practice session consistency and pace differentials

### Derived Features
**Gap-based features**
```
Grid_Gap_to_Pole = GridPosition - min(GridPosition)
Practice_Gap_to_Fastest = CleanAirPace - min(CleanAirPace)
```

**Relative performance**
```
Quali_vs_Teammate = GridPosition - team_mean(GridPosition)
Practice_vs_Quali_Rank = rank(CleanAirPace) - GridPosition
```

### Environmental Data

Air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure
Precipitation detection (boolean)
Weather data integrated via OpenWeatherMap API

## Model Development
### Algorithm Selection Process

**Initial Exploration:** Deep Neural Networks, SVMs, XGBoost

**Issue:** Severe overfitting due to small dataset (n=60)
CV Results: High variance (MAE: 8.4Â±4.0 seconds)


**Final Implementation:** Ridge Regression with L2 regularization

Performance: Test MAE = 3.89 seconds, RÂ² = 0.559
Regularization: Î± = 1.0



## Model Validation

Cross-Validation: 5-fold stratified CV
Stability Analysis: Standard deviation monitoring
Feature Importance: Coefficient magnitude analysis

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Session Data Extraction

```
def get_clean_air_race_pace(year, race):
    # Multi-session aggregation (FP1, FP2, FP3)
    # Track status filtering (green flag conditions only)
    # Personal best lap identification
    # Cross-session minimum selection
```

### Data Quality Controls

Outlier detection and removal (Miami data corruption: 384s average lap times)
Missing value imputation strategies
Multicollinearity assessment and resolution

## Results Analysis
### Model Performance

Ridge Regression MAE: 3.896 seconds
Linear Regression MAE: 3.882 seconds
Cross-Validation Stability: Â±4.0 seconds standard deviation

### Feature Importance (Ridge Regression)

AirTemp: 2.13 (temperature impact on tire performance)
Practice_Gap_to_Fastest: -1.87 (practice pace predictive power)
CleanAirPace_seconds: 1.46 (baseline performance metric)
Race_encoded: -1.07 (track-specific effects)
TeamId_encoded: -0.62 (constructor performance differential)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
### Rookie Driver Problem

Challenge: No historical data for new drivers (ANT, BEA, COL)
Solution: Track similarity analysis using medium-high downforce circuits as proxy data

### Data Scarcity

Challenge: Limited sample size causing overfitting in complex models
Solution: Regularized linear models with comprehensive cross-validation

### Multicollinearity Issues

Detection: Correlation matrix analysis (CleanAirPace vs WindSpeed: -0.987)
Resolution: Feature selection and removal of redundant variables
